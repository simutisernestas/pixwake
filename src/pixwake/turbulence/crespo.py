    """Implements the Crespo-Hernandez wake-added turbulence model.

    This is an empirical model for calculating the turbulence intensity added
    by a wind turbine's wake. The model is based on the thrust coefficient,
    ambient turbulence intensity, and the downwind distance from the turbine.

    Attributes:
        c: A list of four empirical coefficients `[c0, c1, c2, c3]` used in the
           turbulence formula: `TI_add = c0 * a^c1 * TI_amb^c2 * (x/D)^c3`.
        ct2a: A callable that converts the thrust coefficient (`Ct`) to the
            induction factor (`a`).
