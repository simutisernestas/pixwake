    """Approximates the axial induction factor `a` from the thrust coefficient `Ct`.

    This function uses an empirical formula from Madsen et al. (2020) to provide
    a polynomial approximation of the relationship between the thrust
    coefficient and the axial induction factor, as derived from Blade Element
    Momentum (BEM) theory.

    Args:
        ct: A JAX numpy array of thrust coefficients.
        ct2ap: A tuple of polynomial coefficients for the approximation.

    Returns:
        A JAX numpy array of the corresponding axial induction factors.
