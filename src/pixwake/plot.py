    This function generates a contour plot of the wind speed over a specified
    grid, and can optionally overlay the locations of the wind turbines.

    Args:
        grid_x: A JAX numpy array of the x-coordinates of the grid.
        grid_y: A JAX numpy array of the y-coordinates of the grid.
        flow_map_data: A JAX numpy array of the wind speed at each grid point.
        wt_x: An optional JAX numpy array of the x-coordinates of the turbines.
        wt_y: An optional JAX numpy array of the y-coordinates of the turbines.
        show: If `True`, the plot is displayed. This is only active when `ax`
            is not provided.
        ax: An optional Matplotlib `Axes` object to plot on. If not provided, a
            new figure and axes are created.

    Returns:
        The Matplotlib `Axes` object on which the flow map was plotted.
